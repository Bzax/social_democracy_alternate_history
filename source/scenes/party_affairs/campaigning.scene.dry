= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its membership and voterbase. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The proletarians, our traditional base.
- @public: Public sector workers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @private: Private sector workers, the backbone of the workers movement.
- @homeowners: The "new middle class" of homeowning workers.
- @rural: The "old middle class" of small business owners and independent farmers.
- @unemployed: The unemployed.
- @youth: Students and the broader youth.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard

By doubling down on the protection of state mortgages and stable socialist leadership, we have increased our campaigning among the new middle class â€“ the workers who own their homes. [? if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0: The popular antipathy towards socialism among this group makes our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?] [? if nationalism >= 51 and peoples_party == 0: The high levels of nationalism among this group make our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?]

By promising public works programs and stable socialist leadership, we have increased our campaigning among the unemployed. [? if welfare < 0: The welfare cuts and resultant poverty make our campaign more difficult, since we are associated with the government that enacted these cuts, and our campaign may even backfire. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract support from the unemployed. ?]
